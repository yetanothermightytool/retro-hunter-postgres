# Retro Hunter - PostgresSQL üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
**Security Scanner & Threat Audit Tool** for Veeam Backup & Replication Restore Points using the Veeam Data Integration API.

## üõ°Ô∏èFind Threats in Your Backups ‚Äì With Retro Hunter
Imagine you‚Äôre responsible for your company‚Äôs security. You have backups. You trust them. But what if malware or suspicious files are hiding right now or were silently active weeks ago? Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to look inside your backups, like a time machine, and search for threats?

That‚Äôs exactly what Retro Hunter does!
It connects directly to your Veeam backups and scans files from past restore points for signs of malware, hacked binaries, and other suspicious behavior. And the best part: it comes with a beautiful, easy-to-use dashboard that shows you everything.

Retro Hunter is a lightweight Python-based toolkit that scans Veeam Backup & Replication restore points for malware, suspicious binaries, and unusual patterns. It allows you to investigate historical restore points and perform regular scans over time. By integrating with threat intelligence sources like MalwareBazaar, it continuously checks known file hashes and monitors the scanning results.

## ‚úÖ Key Features
- Search for Veeam backups from a specific host or Veeam Backup Repository
- Mounts the manually selected backup via the Veeam Data Integration API
- Mounts the latest restore point from all supported platforms from a Veeam Backup Repository
- Scans mounted Veeam restore points
- Saves useful metadata from the presented files
- Parallelized scanning using Python‚Äôs multiprocessing for fast performance
- Tracks file changes across restore points (hash or size drift)
- Detects known malware using hash lookups from MalwareBazaar
- Identifies out-of-place LOLBAS (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts)
- Optionally applies YARA rules to selected file types during scan
- Optionally scans the Windows Eventlog for specific event-ids (Security/PowerShell)
- Optionally scans specific Windows Registry Hives
- Displays findings in a Streamlit dashboard
- Uses PostgreSQL as the database

## üöÄ Quickstart (tl;dr)
Run the setup script, and start scanning! Execute `setup.sh` with the path to your `malwarebazaar.csv` file to initialize the environment and databases. Once done, you can use `retro-hunter.py` to analyze mounted restore points for malware, LOLBAS, and YARA hits, or to index all executables and scripts. Finally, open the dashboard at https://<your-hostname>:8501 to explore the results.

**Important** You must add the Linux server on which this script is executed to the [backup infrastructure](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/add_linux_server.html).

**Tested on UBUNTU 24.04**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Process
The setup process is simplified with the setup.sh script. You only need to download the malwarebazaar.csv file (See more in the [Technical Details of the Scripts](#database) and run the script on your Linux host. You will be asked for the Veeam Backup & Replication Server hostname, REST API user, and a password during the setup. The password will be securely encrypted and stored using Fernet.

```bash
./setup.sh /path/to/malwarebazaar.csv retro-hunter
```

## üê≥ Docker Support
A minimal Docker setup is provided to run the Streamlit dashboard and the PostgreSQL database as a container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details of the Scripts
## Version Information
~~~~
Version: 2.1 (Aug 5 2025)
Requires: Veeam Backup & Replication v12.3.1 & Linux & Python 3.1+
Author: Stephan "Steve" Herzig
~~~~

## Prerequisites
Some preparations are required for this script to run. 

### Veeam Backup & Replication
- You must add the Linux server on which this script is executed to the [backup infrastructure](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/add_linux_server.html).
- Create a separate user for REST API access. The user must be assigned the ‚ÄúVeeam Backup Administrator‚Äù role.

### Python Modules
The following Python modules are not part of the standard library and must be installed separately using pip. A requirements.txt contains the necessary modules.
- requests
- cryptography (for cryptography.fernet.Fernet)
- colorama
- yara (usually installed via yara-python)
- python-evtx for Windows Event Log scanning 
- and more for the Docker containers (requirements.txt)

## YARA Rules
Save additional YARA rule files in the script folder directory yara_rules. (File extensions .yar and .yara). A sample rule is stored in the yara_rules directory.

### YARA Rules Generator
The Streamlit Dashboard includes a YARA rule generator that creates rules based on stored executables with high entropy and PE metadata.

## Database Content
The malwarebazaar table in badfiles.db contains the SHA256 values of the malware files. Download the complete [data dump](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/#csv) and unzip the CSV file as malwarebazaar.csv to the folder where the setup.sh script is stored. The setup.sh script will import the values into the database.

_(optional)_ YARA scan mode (off, all, suspicious, content)

## store.py script details
This script scans the mounted file system and collects detailed metadata for selected files (DEFAULT_BINARY_EXTS list or --filetypes is used). It calculates a SHA-256 hash for each file and stores all data in a local SQLite database. If the database does not exist, it is automatically created during the first run. The metadata stored includes file name, path, size, timestamps, extension, file type, and whether the file is executable. Each entry is tagged with a hostname, restore point ID, and timestamp, making later comparisons across backups possible.
The script supports parallel processing and can speed up scanning using multiple CPU cores. Filters can be applied to limit which files are scanned: only specific file types (like .exe or .dll), a maximum file size, and folders to exclude. 
The script extracts key information for each file that matches the filters and calculates its SHA-256 hash. All collected data is inserted into the database, unless an entry with the same hostname and hash already exists.

### File Type Detection (Simple explanation)
The script detects files based on their extensions:
- Executables: .exe, .dll, .bin, .sh, etc. 
- Scripts: .py, .js, .ps1, .bat 
- Images: .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. 
- Documents: .pdf, .docx, .txt, etc. 
- Archives: .zip, .tar, .7z, etc.
If a file doesn‚Äôt match known types, it is labeled "other".

### Entropy Calculation
Entropy is calculated using the Shannon entropy formula, based on the distribution of byte values in the file. The script reads the full content of each file and computes how evenly the byte values (0‚Äì255) are distributed, which reflects the randomness of the data. Highly random content is typical for encrypted, packed, or obfuscated files‚Äîtechniques often used by malware to avoid detection.
When such high-entropy files are found in directories like AppData, ProgramData, Temp, Public, Downloads, or Recycle.Bin, they are flagged as potentially suspicious. These locations are frequently abused by attackers to stage or hide payloads, since they are writable and often excluded from routine checks. By correlating entropy levels with file system paths, the dashboard view aims to surface files that deserve further analysis, even if they have not been flagged by signature-based scanners.

### Entropy Classification Range
| Entropy Range | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.0 ‚Äì 3.5     | Very low entropy ‚Äì likely plain text, config files, or uncompressed data.  |
| 3.5 ‚Äì 6.5     | Medium entropy ‚Äì common for standard executables, DLLs, scripts, etc.      |
| 6.5 ‚Äì 7.5     | Elevated entropy ‚Äì may indicate mild compression or some obfuscation.      |
| > 7.5         | High entropy ‚Äì potentially packed, encrypted, or malicious (e.g., malware).|'

For executable files with high entropy (>= 7.5), store.py automatically extracts additional metadata, including file type signatures (Magic) and Portable Executable (PE) attributes to support deeper malware analysis. It helps detect packed malware, malware droppers with recent compilation dates, and potentially unwanted programs. The results are displayed in the dashboard. (Entropy >= 7.9 and PE Timestamp > 2024-06-15)

## event-parser.py script  
The event-parser.py script extracts and analyzes security-related events from Windows event logs. It focuses on a defined set of Event IDs (Security & PowerShell Event Log) known to indicate potential threats, policy changes, or suspicious PowerShell usage.

‚Ä¢ Windows Security Event Ids (High Severity)
4618, 4649, 4719, 4765, 4766, 4794, 4897, 4964, 5124, 1102

The list is based on official Microsoft recommendations [Microsoft: Events to Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/appendix-l--events-to-monitor).

‚Ä¢ PowerShell Events Ids
800, 4104

These events are parsed, stored in the database, and visualized in the dashboard with severity classifications (High / Medium to High).

## Registry scanner script details
**coming soon**

## Retro Hunter PostgreSQL Cleanup Script (db-cleaner.py)

This script removes outdated entries from key PostgreSQL tables in your Retro Hunter environment:
‚Ä¢ files
‚Ä¢ scan_findings
‚Ä¢ win_events
‚Ä¢ registry (to be added)

### Options

Option Description
- `--days N` Delete entries older than N days (based on restore point timestamp fields)

- `--clean-only` Only delete entries that are not flagged as malware/YARA/LOLBAS hits
- `--host HOSTNAME` Restrict cleanup to a specific hostname
### Examples

Dry-run: preview deletions older than 60 days
```bash
./db-cleaner.py --days 60 --dry-run
```
Fully delete old non-malicious data
```bash
./db-cleaner.py --days 90 --clean-only
```
Cleanup only for a specific host
```bash
./db-cleaner.py --days 30 --host WIN-VM1
```

## Coming Soon
- MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)

## Possible improvements
- Mark the scanned restore point as infected in Veeam Backup & Replication.
- And a few other nice things that I'm currently researching.

## Considerations and Limitations
- The scripts have been created and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 and Veeam Backup & Replication 12.3.1 and 12.3.2
- Only filesystems with the NTFS can be scanned when presenting the restore points using iSCSI
- When mounting NTFS disks, it‚Äôs important to know that Ubuntu (from version 24.04 and newer) uses the built-in ntfs3 kernel driver, which provides better performance and more stable access. In contrast, Rocky Linux and other RHEL-based systems usually rely on the older ntfs-3g driver through FUSE, which is slower because it runs in user space. This means that the way NTFS is handled can vary depending on the system. It is technically possible to upgrade Rocky Linux to a newer Kernel (5.15 or higher) to support the native ntfs3 driver. Mounting NTFS volumes works well when using the -t ntfs parameter, especially with iSCSI attached disks. FUSE is not working and there are currently no efforts to conduct further research in this area.
